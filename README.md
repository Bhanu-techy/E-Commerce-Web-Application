## Title

***Ecomerce Web App***


## Overview

This project is a React-based E-Commerce frontend application designed to simulate a real-world online shopping experience. Users can browse products, view detailed product information, choose quantities, and add items to a shopping cart. The application emphasizes clean UI, smooth navigation, and efficient state management.

The project was developed as part of hands-on learning to strengthen React fundamentals and frontend architecture concepts.

## Objectives

-Build a functional E-Commerce user interface using React

-Implement seamless navigation between product listing and product detail pages

-Manage cart state efficiently across components

-Apply React best practices and reusable component design


### Evaluation Criteria

-We will evaluate you based on the following:

-Code Structure: Clean and organized code.

-Naming Conventions: Proper naming conventions for classes, components, and files.

-Use of Pre-built JS Packages: Minimize the use of unnecessary pre-built JS package-s.

-Screen Size Fit: Ensure that the design fits well on all screen sizes.

-Minimized DOM Size: Keep the DOM size as minimal as possible for performance optimization.


## Key Features

-Product listing with reusable product cards

-Search and filter functionality for products

-Detailed product view page

-Quantity selection for products

-Add to cart functionality

-Dynamic cart updates using global state

-Smooth navigation using React Router

-Responsive UI for better user experience


## Application Workflow

1. User lands on the Home / Products page displaying a list of products

2. User can search or filter products

3. Clicking the “View More” button navigates to the Product Details page

4. On the Product Details page:

5. Full product information is displayed

    -User selects the desired product quantity
